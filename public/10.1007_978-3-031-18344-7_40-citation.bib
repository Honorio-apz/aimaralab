abstract="In Latin America, there is a culture called Aymara, which has its own language also named Aymara. It is a native language in danger of extension declared by UNESCO and a heritage of the Peruvian nation. The work of Neural Machine Translator since its appearance has been able to translate many languages of the world, however it is not very well researched with native languages, in this work we experience for the first time the automatic translation from Aymara to English with the seq2seq model. First interesting results were obtained that could open up new research projects.",
