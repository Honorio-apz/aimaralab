    texto_blog: "We are proud to announce a historic specific collaboration agreement between AIMARA LAB and the National Center for Artificial Intelligence of Chile (CENIA). This five-year alliance marks a pivotal moment for AI in our region, uniting two key institutions to tackle a monumental challenge: creating a foundational Large Language Model (LLM) for Latin America.<br><br>The project, named the \"Gran Modelo del Lenguaje (LLM) Latinoamericano,\" is led by CENIA and aims to develop an open-source large language model that will serve as a cornerstone for technological and scientific advancement across the region[cite: 37, 38].<br><br><strong>A Collaborative Effort for Regional Advancement</strong><br><br>This project is a testament to the power of collaboration. Both institutions will bring their unique strengths to the table to ensure the success of the Latin American LLM. <br><br><strong>AIMARA LAB's Commitments include:</strong><br><br><ul><li>- Supporting the collection of open data in various domains of Latin American Spanish.</li><li>- Providing technical assistance during the training process of the Large Language Models.</li><li>- Promoting the exchange of academic personnel, including professors and researchers, to foster shared knowledge.</li></ul><br><strong>CENIA's Commitments include:</strong><br><br><ul><li>- Providing all necessary computational power and equipment for the training, testing, and alignment of the LLM.</li><li>- Managing all legal aspects related to data governance, including licensing and availability.</li><li>- Ensuring access to all necessary technical resources for the project's development.</li></ul><br><strong>Openness as a Core Principle</strong><br><br>A fundamental pillar of this project is the commitment to openness. CENIA will guarantee that the license for all elements of the Latin American LLMâ€”including the data, architecture, and final model weightsâ€”is as open as possible, aiming for standards like CC-BY 4.0 or MIT. This ensures that the resulting technology will be a public good, accessible to researchers, developers, and innovators throughout Latin America.<br><br>The final product will be a neural network trained on Spanish language data, including its architecture and final weights.<br><br><strong>A New Chapter for AI in Latin America</strong><br><br>We are honored to join forces with CENIA on this transformative initiative. This agreement is more than a technical project; it is a shared vision to build technological sovereignty and empower our regional scientific community. Together, we are laying the groundwork for a future where AI is developed by and for Latin America.",

    texto_blog: "Under the motto 'Solving Challenges Like in Silicon Valley', outstanding Peruvian professionals working in top companies like Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix shared their knowledge and experiences for the first time at the Universidad San Pablo in Arequipa. With previous editions held at renowned institutions such as Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley, Techsuyo 2023 returned as one of the most important technology conferences in Latin America.\n\nDuring two intensive daysâ€”September 6 and 7, 2023â€”the event offered workshops, panels, and a hackathon, with over 30 experts addressing challenges and opportunities in technology development within high-performance environments like Silicon Valley. Featured speakers included Spencer Friedman (Rappi), Angela GaldÃ³s (Google), Emilia Paz (Google Chrome), Omar Flores (IBM Research), Luis Larco (Google X), and Bruno Wong (Amazon).\n\nRepresenting the National University of Moquegua (UNAM), a group of seven studentsâ€”Allison Reynoso, Jamir Bacona, Selime Maquera, Yoselin Arocutipa, Estrella Velasquez, Mariela Nina, and Jhormely Sosaâ€”had the opportunity to participate in this international event. The experience not only highlighted the differences between the national context and global innovation standards but also served as inspiration to take an important step: the creation of the AiMara Research Group, officially registered at UNAM.\n\nSince then, this group has initiated regular meetings where natural discussions about artificial intelligence and its fields have driven the development of projects with a global vision. Following the premise 'create technology, rather than just learn to use it', these young researchers have embarked on a path toward innovation and technological development.\n\nDirect contact and conversations with the Techsuyo 2023 speakers marked a turning point for this emerging group in Moquegua, turning received inspiration into concrete actions aimed at creating knowledge and technology from southern Peru.",

    texto_blog: "The name 'AiMARA' comes from the fusion of 'AI' (Artificial Intelligence) and 'MARA', a word in the Aymara language meaning 'year', symbolizing the beginning of a new era of inclusive technology. This union represents the convergence between technological innovation and Andean cultural roots, demonstrating that artificial intelligence can also be built from identity and diversity.\n\nThe term was publicly mentioned for the first time by Honorio Apaza during an interview, when presenting his first prototype of a machine translator for the Aymara language. Naming it 'AiMARA' reflected the cultural and technological essence of his project: developing artificial intelligence that actively involves indigenous communities. That moment marked the official birth of the AiMARA concept.\n\nShortly after, the name transcended its initial technical role and became the symbol of a shared vision. In 2019, at the National University of Moquegua (UNAM), the AiMARA Research Group was born, where students and teachers took on the challenge of creating their own technologies in natural language processing and computer vision, guided by the motto: create technology, not just learn to use it.\n\nIn 2025, this dream evolved with the creation of AiMARA Lab, a non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research, technological development, and the digital preservation of ancestral culture. AiMARA Lab combines science, education, and innovation with an ethical and socially responsible perspective.\n\nToday, the term 'AiMARA' is no longer just a technical name nor a linguistic coincidence. It is a symbol of how technology can be born from our roots and become a tool for cultural preservation and empowerment of indigenous peoples. From southern Peru, AiMARA Lab shows that artificial intelligence can also be created by and for communities.\n\nAiMARA Lab is committed to developing artificial intelligence technologies with local impact and global projection.",
