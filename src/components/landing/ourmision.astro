          The AiMara Research Group emerged in Peru from a collective desire to create rather than simply use emerging technologies. This dynamic team, composed of students and faculty from the National University of Moqueguaâ€™s School of Systems Engineering, formed during discussions about advancements in artificial intelligence.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-8">
          In 2022, members of the group achieved significant milestones by publishing two scientific papers titled "Neural Machine Translator for Native Language Aimara to English and Spanish" at the Proceedings of the Future Technologies Conference (FTC) and Intelligent Systems and Applications (IntelliSys 2022). The AI model they developed was named "AIMARA," symbolizing their mission and cultural heritage. "Aimara" derives from "jayamararu," meaning "language of many years," while the acronym reflects "AI" for Artificial Intelligence and "MARA" for "year" in Spanish, denoting the era of artificial intelligence.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-8">
                   
          On January 24, 2024, the group was officially registered at the university, solidifying their commitment to interdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence and related fields. The AiMara Research Group aims to innovate and inspire future generations, proving that creativity and knowledge can transform the technological landscape of Peru.
