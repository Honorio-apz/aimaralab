          AiMara Lab was founded in Peru with the purpose of leading responsible innovation in artificial intelligence. It emerged from the collaborative efforts of researchers and students who shared a strong commitment to scientific development, social impact, and ethical technology.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed ">
          In 2022, a milestone was reached with the publication of “Neural Machine Translator for Native Language Aimara to English and Spanish”. This highlighted the lab’s focus on language technologies and cultural preservation.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-3 leading-relaxed ">
          The name AiMara combines “AI” for Artificial Intelligence and “MARA” from the Aymara language, meaning “year” — representing a new era of inclusive technology.
