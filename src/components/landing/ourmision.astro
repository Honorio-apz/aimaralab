          The AiMara Research Group was founded in Peru with a vision beyond merely adopting emerging technologies—it was created to drive innovation. Comprising students and faculty from the National University of Moquegua’s School of Systems Engineering, the group emerged from discussions on advancements in artificial intelligence, united by a shared passion for research and technological development.          
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-8">
          In 2022, the group reached significant milestones by publishing two scientific papers: "Neural Machine Translator for Native Language Aimara to English and Spanish" in the Proceedings of the Future Technologies Conference (FTC) and Intelligent Systems and Applications (IntelliSys 2022). Their AI model, named AIMARA, embodies both their mission and cultural heritage. The name AiMara originates from two languages: Aymara and English. In Aymara, it derives from "jayamararu," meaning "language of many years", while in English, the acronym integrates "AI" for Artificial Intelligence and "MARA," meaning "year", symbolizing the era of AI.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 mb-8">
                   
          On January 24, 2024, the group was officially registered at the university, reinforcing its commitment to interdisciplinary research in artificial intelligence and related fields. The AiMara Research Group continues to push boundaries, striving to inspire future generations and demonstrating that creativity and knowledge can transform Peru’s technological landscape.        </p>
